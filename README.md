> Kronos was a semi-custom server that was hosted from May to September of 2020.
> The goal was to have the features of a modern deob client such as GPU rendering while also having high quality custom content.
> This package has been collecting dust in my github repository and I'd like to release it to the community in hopes that it may inspire some users.
